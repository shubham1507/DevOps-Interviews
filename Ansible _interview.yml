Can you explain the structure of an Ansible Playbook using roles?

Answer: A playbook’s role-based structure, often created via ansible-galaxy, includes folders like defaults, handlers, tasks, templates, and meta. Roles organize tasks, variables, and handlers, enabling conditional execution (e.g., for different OSes) and reuse across projects.


What are handlers in Ansible, and why are they used?

Answer: Handlers are triggered by notify directives to execute tasks only when specific conditions are met (e.g., restarting Nginx after a config change). They ensure conditional, efficient execution for actions like service restarts.


How can you run a specific set of tasks only on Windows VMs and not on Linux VMs?

Answer: Use tags or conditional statements based on environment variables (e.g., OS type) to target Windows VMs, ensuring tasks are skipped for Linux VMs.


Does Ansible support parallel execution?

Answer: Yes, tasks run in parallel across all hosts configured (e.g., task 1 on all VMs, then task 2). Tasks are serial, but parallelism can be increased by adjusting the forks parameter or using multiple Ansible instances.


What protocol does Ansible use to connect to Windows VMs?

Answer: WinRM connects to Windows VMs, while SSH is used for Linux VMs.


Can you place group vars, role vars, and extra vars in order? of precedence?

Answer: Precedence is: extra vars (highest), role vars, then group vars. Multiple variable sources (e.g., playbook vars, cached facts) require understanding precedence for accurate application.


How do you handle secrets in Ansible?

Answer: Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data or integrate with external vaults like HashiCorp Vault. Secrets can be passed securely via environment variables, avoiding plain-text storage.


Can Ansible be used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and how does it compare to Terraform?

Answer: Ansible supports some IaC tasks (e.g., provisioning AWS EC2 instances) but it’s primarily for configuration management. Terraform excels at infrastructure provisioning, while Ansible focuses on configuration post-provisioning.

What exactly is an Ansible module, and how have you used it in your project?

Answer: Modules are task-specific tools for actions like file editing (e.g., replacing a string) or package management (e.g., yum for installs). They’re used in playbooks to execute specific configurations.


Do you use more Playbooks or ad hoc commands in Ansible, and why do we have them?

Answer: Playbooks are preferred for structured, repeatable tasks, while ad hoc commands handle quick, one-off tests. Ad hoc commands are not ideal for production, as playbooks offer better configuration control with variables.


What are you handling, errors, and how do you handle errors in Ansible? Playbooks?

Answer: Use ignore_errors to continue despite errors, failed_when to set failure conditions, or block statements for graceful error handling. Error handlers can trigger recovery actions.


What is the ignore_errors directive in Ansible?

Answer: ignore_errors allows a playbook to continue execution despite a task failure, treating the failed task as passed to ensure completion.


How do you use Ansible facts?

Answer: Facts collect system info (e.g., OS, IP, hardware) from managed nodes, used as variables in playbooks for conditional decisions based on host properties.


How do you manage the order of task execution in an Ansible Playbook?

Answer: Tasks execute in the order written. The serial keyword controls batch execution across hosts for precise ordering.


What is the concept of idempotency in Ansible?

Answer: Idempotency ensures a task run multiple times has the same effect as once. Ansible compares the current state to the desired state, executing only necessary actions.


What are Ansible roles, and how do you use them?

Answer: Roles organize playbooks into reusable units with a standard structure (tasks, variables, handlers), reducing complexity and enabling reuse for configurations and deployments.


Explain the difference between Ansible ad hoc commands and Playbooks.

Answer: Ad hoc commands are one-off, command-line tasks for simple actions. Playbooks are YAML files with organized, repeatable tasks for complex operations.
